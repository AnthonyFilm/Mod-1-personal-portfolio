        <h1>Anthony J. Lenzo</h1>
        <p >Anthony has been making films since the days of bell-bottoms when their dad first put a 8mm camera
             in their hand. Since then they've been documenting and distorting theirs and others’ 
             lives through writing and video. They have a bachelor's degree from New College of Florida 
             in philosophy and physics, and a master’s degree in communication from Purdue University, 
             with additional masters-level film production training at Governors State University. 
             They trained in improv performance at Chicago’s Second City and writing at the Writers’ Loft. 
             They have written and directed several short films and served as director of photography for the 
             independent feature film Alchemy in Hyde Park (dir. Robert Beshara, 2014). 
             After 17 years living in the Chicago area, Anthony moved back to Florida. 
             They are passionate about teaching and empowering their students to use their 
             creative power wisely. They have taught public speaking, film and mass communication at 
             Purdue University, Moraine Valley Community College, and the Chicago Wisdom Project.  
             In addition to teaching Film & Narrative at Ringling, they have also taught public speaking,
              film production and screenwriting at the State College of Florida. 
              They are the developer and director of the Filmmakers' Summer Camp at the 
              Sarasota Film Society. They are a past member of Chicago Filmmakers, 
              the Chicago Screenwriting Network and the Chicago Final Cut Pro Users Group. 
              They also never back down from a puntastic challenge.</p>
